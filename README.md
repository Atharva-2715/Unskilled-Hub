# Unskilled-Hub
This was a website which would have helped workers to gain jobs by creating their profiles so the users can provide them work. I have used HTML and CSS for this project as I am still in the learning phase of my career but I think this website can be implemented in a more efficient manner and it can be developed in a more professional way.
